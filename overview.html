This is a comprehensive high accuracy positional astronomy library. 
Positional astronomy deals with determining the positions of astronomical
objects in the sky - typically the apparent positions as seen by an observer
on the Earth. To do this accurately you need to account for a number of 
factors including the position of the observer on the Earth, the shape
of the Earth, atmospheric refraction, the orientation of the Earth in space,
The effect of the Earth's motion through space, including special relativistic
effects, general relativistic deflection of light by the sun. In addition, you
need to accurately measure time and predict the positions of bodies in the
solar system.
<p>
Positional astronomy and this library are useful for sky
visualization (e.g. planetarium programs), pointing telescopes, observation
planning, and more.
<p>
The state of the art for positional astronomy gives microarcsecond accuracy,
and is laid out in a set of models and conventions adopted by the International
Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2000. This library is fully compliant with the 
IAU 2000 conventions but has a pluggable architecture so that you can
trade computational speed for accuracy when needed. 
<p>
This library has many packages but the following are good starting places to 
learn about the capabilities of eap.sky .
<p>
The {@link eap.sky.time} package extends Java's Date class to provide nanosecond
precision and support for the myriad of timekeeping systems used in positional
astronomy.<p>

The {@link eap.sky.earth} package computes the precise orientation of the
Earth in space, including precession, nutation, rotation, and polar motion.<p>
 
The {@link eap.sky.util} package handles the mechanics of spherical coordinates,
transforms, and projections, while {@link eap.sky.util.coordinates} handles
specific coordinate systems, such as RA/Dec and Az/Alt.<p>

The {@link eap.sky.ephemeris} package is for determining the positions of
bodies in the solar system. It supports the JPL DE405 ephemeris, which represents
the current state of the art in accuracy.<p>

The {@link eap.sky.stars} package handles star catalogs. The catalogs are arranged into
hierarchical tessellations of the sky which can be searched in log time. This
way eap.sky can handle even extremely large catalogs efficiently.<p>
